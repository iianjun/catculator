# Privacy Policy for Catculator

**Effective Date:** February 8, 2026

**Last Updated:** February 8, 2026

---

## Introduction

Welcome to Catculator ("we," "our," or "the app"). Catculator is a mobile application designed to help cat owners calculate their pet's daily calorie requirements to maintain a healthy weight.

We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how Catculator handles information when you use our mobile application available on iOS (Apple App Store) and Android (Google Play Store).

**The short version:** Catculator is built with privacy as a core principle. The app performs all calculations locally on your device and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information or data about you or your cat.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Information You Provide

When you use Catculator, you may input the following information about your cat:

- Weight (in kilograms or pounds)
- Life stage and activity status (e.g., kitten, neutered, intact, active, inactive)
- Food calorie information (when using the food portion calculator)

**Important:** This information is processed entirely on your device. It is NOT transmitted to our servers, NOT stored in any database, and NOT shared with any third parties. Once you close the app or navigate away from a calculation, this data is not retained.

### 1.2 Information We DO NOT Collect

Catculator does not collect:

- Personal information (name, email, phone number, address)
- Device identifiers for tracking or advertising purposes
- Location data
- Photos or camera access
- Contact lists
- Usage analytics or behavioral data
- Crash reports or diagnostic data (unless you explicitly opt in through your device's operating system settings)

### 1.3 Information Automatically Collected

**Local Device Interactions:** The app uses your device's haptic feedback (vibration) capabilities to enhance the user experience when you interact with buttons. This feature operates entirely on your device and does not send any data externally.

**Font Loading:** The app loads a custom font (Press Start 2P) for its retro pixel art aesthetic. This font file is bundled within the app and does not require any external data transmission.

**Platform Services:** As an Expo-based React Native app, Catculator may use platform-level services provided by Apple (iOS) or Google (Android) for core app functionality such as app updates and installation. These services are governed by Apple's and Google's respective privacy policies, not by this policy.

---

## 2. How We Use Information

Since Catculator does not collect or store personal information, there is no data to "use" in the traditional sense.

The data you enter (cat weight, status, food information) is used solely and exclusively for:

- Performing on-device calorie calculations using established veterinary formulas
- Displaying calculation results to you within the app
- Enabling you to compare different food portions based on calorie content

All processing happens locally on your device. No data leaves your device as part of the app's core functionality.

---

## 3. Data Storage and Security

### 3.1 Local Storage

Catculator does not persistently store the information you enter. When you input your cat's weight and status, that data exists temporarily in your device's memory for the duration of your calculation session and is discarded when you exit the app or navigate to a different screen.

### 3.2 No Server-Side Storage

Our backend server (used only to serve a landing page website) does not receive, process, or store any calculator data or personal information from the mobile app. There are no API calls between the mobile app and our servers during normal app usage.

### 3.3 Security Measures

Because we do not collect or transmit your data, the primary security measure is the inherent privacy of local processing. Your data never leaves your device, which eliminates the vast majority of data breach risks associated with cloud-based services.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

### 4.1 Expo Framework

Catculator is built using Expo, a framework for React Native applications. Expo may collect limited technical information for diagnostic purposes (such as crash reports) if you have opted into such reporting through your device settings. We do not control or have access to any data collected by Expo. For more information, please review Expo's privacy policy at: https://expo.dev/privacy

### 4.2 Apple App Store and Google Play Store

When you download or update Catculator through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, Apple and Google may collect information about the download and installation. This data collection is governed by Apple's and Google's privacy policies, respectively:

- Apple Privacy Policy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/
- Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

### 4.3 No Advertising or Analytics

Catculator does not integrate any third-party advertising networks, analytics services, or tracking technologies. We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or similar technologies within the mobile app.

---

## 5. Children's Privacy

Catculator does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). In fact, Catculator does not collect personal information from users of any age.

Because the app performs all calculations locally and does not require user accounts or data submission, it can be safely used by individuals of all ages. However, the app is designed for pet owners and assumes a level of understanding appropriate for responsible pet care.

If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns about your child's use of Catculator, please contact us at dev.hasung@gmail.com.
